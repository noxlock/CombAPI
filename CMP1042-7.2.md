# CMP1042-7.2

## Discuss how you will address the following obligations as a developer:

###  \- Professional Obligations 

#### Delivering the Project On Time

To address the issue of delivering the project on time, I would have constant back-and-forth communication with the client during the entire development process of the project. I would set up a road map using a platform such as Trello, so we can discuss what stage the project is at, what we currently have, and what's next on the agenda.

#### Being Explicit About Ongoing Maintenance of the System

In these constant back-and-forth chats with the client, I would be upfront about any plans for maintenance, soon, or in the future. When such maintenance occurs all requests will be forwarded to a route separate from the project which informs the user the system is under maintenance. The maintenance would also be announced on social media platforms. Throughout this entire process, we'll provide details of the maintenance, such as any hiccups we encounter that may affect maintenance times, to the client.

### \- Ethical Obligations

####  Ensuring That the Application Conforms With Ethical Codes of Conduct Approved By Industry

As the maintainer of the project, I will strive to maintain guidelines that correlate with both the `Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct` developed by the Association for Computer Machinery, and also the `Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice` from both ACM and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.

The most notable guidelines among these two are the privacy of data, and to avoid developing a project that can project harm onto others in some way.



### \- Legal Obligations

#### Whether the Application Is Subject to Any Legal Regulation, If None, Consider Any Privacy Implications

Due to the wide use of outsourced technologies, the project is subject to legal regulations in the form of many licenses. Node.js has their own customised license depicting what you can and cannot do with their software, which also affects the `crypto` package, as it is a standard library that comes with Node. `Express`, `Morgan`, `Helmet`, `better-sqlite`, `body-parser`, `pug` and `node-fetch` all fall under the MIT license, which means that for those packages, we must include both the original copyright and license, and we cannot hold the original package maintainers liable for any problems we encounter.

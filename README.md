# CombAPI

## Communications (Data)base API



### Overview

CombAPI is a web API that allows the fetching of data from a sqlite database. The API was developed to have a full-stack application that interacts with a database, and performs queries to it, as well as using middleware to ensure the security of the application.

The database structure is loosely based on something you would find for VoIP applications like Discord.



The API has all three layers of a project:

- Presentation (basic HTML & CSS)
- Application (Node, Express, other middleware)
- Database (sqlite)
